Development of AI capability evaluations based on the ARENA Chapter 3 curriculum

In this project I generally follow the flow of Chapter 3 in the ARENA curriculum, however I have refactored their code to serve my purposes in this project.

## Project Description
For this evaluation I develop a political bias threat model, create a set of 300 MCQs, and implement them in the Inspect framework for model evaluation.
As a secondary component, I am utilizing an older (less capable) model to assist in the development of the MCQs that will be used to evaluate the current frontier models (more capable). This emphasizes a component of AI safety research that I believe will be critical moving forward, where we use currently trusted models to evaluate the safety of the latest models.
